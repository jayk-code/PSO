# Particle-swarm-optimizer-and-its-use-in-gravitational-wave-data-analysis
In this project I am investigating the use of particle swarm optimizer algorithm for detection of gravitational wave signal from  compact binary coalescences(black hole and neutron star mergers) and estimating various parameters associated with it.

Particle swarm optimization algorithm tries to find the optimum(minimum or maximum) for given function in the given space.
